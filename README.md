Simple std::vector implementation in Java.

Here are just some of the methods of the original std::vector. You can see a more detailed implementation in C++ in my repository "myContainers".

For this implementation, I used index access instead of iterators in some methods.

Perhaps in the future I will make other STL collections in Java.
